# When we stop and restart on GCE, new public IP addresses are assigned
# We therefore need to fix all configurations that contain these public
# IP addresses:
# * our SSH configuration
# * the VNC URL which contains the Horizon node IP
# Also make sure to run terraform apply at least once to put the
# new public IP addresses into the cached output
