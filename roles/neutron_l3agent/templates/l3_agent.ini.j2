# networking node to provide L3 services like DNAT, and SNAT. Use this mode if
# you do not want to adopt DVR. 'dvr' - this mode enables DVR functionality and
# must be used for an L3 agent that runs on a compute host. 'dvr_snat' - this
# enables centralized SNAT support in conjunction with DVR.  This mode must be
# used for an L3 agent running on a centralized node (or in single-host
# deployments, e.g. devstack). 'dvr_no_external' - this mode enables only
# East/West DVR routing functionality for a L3 agent that runs on a compute
# host, the North/South functionality such as DNAT and SNAT will be provided by
# the centralized network node that is running in 'dvr_snat' mode. This mode
