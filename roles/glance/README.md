glance
=========

This role installs Glance on a node. The following configuration are done compared to the packaged version of the configuration files.

In glance-api.conf:

- we will add the specific configuration for the Keystone service and memcached in the section keystone_authtoken
- set the deployment flavor to keystone in the paste_deploy section. This will be combined with the service name glance-api and be used as a lookup into the WSGI pipeline (i.e. the chain of middleware components that are called before the actual application code is invoked) configuration in /etc/glance/glance-api-paste.ini. This setting will make sure that as part of the pipeline, Keystone is used for authorization. Note that Glance is deployed in a standalone WSGI server, not on top of Apache2
- set the database connection string in the database section


In glance-registry.conf:

- set database connection
- set keystone_authtoken configuration as above
- set deployment flavor as above

We then use the glance-manage tool to sync the glance database scheme and restart the Glance service. Finally, we download and import the CirrOS image.
