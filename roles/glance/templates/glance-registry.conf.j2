# when the algorithm is applied to the uploaded or imported image data.
#
# The value must be a valid secure hash algorithm name recognized by the
# python 'hashlib' library.  You can determine what these are by examining
# the 'hashlib.algorithms_available' data member of the version of the
# library being used in your Glance installation.  For interoperability
# purposes, however, we recommend that you use the set of secure hash
# names supplied by the 'hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed' data member because
