# Usually, disk bus is determined automatically from the device type or disk

# operators changes ``[compute]/max_disk_devices_to_attach`` to 20, a request to
# rebuild server A will fail and go into ERROR state because 26 devices are
# already attached and exceed the new configured maximum of 20.

# Operators setting ``[compute]/max_disk_devices_to_attach`` should also be

# that during a cold migration, the configured maximum is only enforced in-place

# has set a maximum of 26 on compute host A and a maximum of 20 on compute host
# B, a cold migration of a server with 26 attached devices from compute host A
# to
# compute host B will succeed. Then, once the server is on compute host B, a

# This allows specifying granular CPU feature flags when configuring CPU

# (Process-Context ID, an Intel processor feature -- which is now required
# to address the guest performance degradation as a result of applying the
# "Meltdown" CVE fixes to certain Intel CPU models) flag to the
# "IvyBridge" virtual CPU model::
#
#     [libvirt]
#     cpu_mode = custom
#     cpu_model = IvyBridge
#     cpu_model_extra_flags = pcid
#
# To specify multiple CPU flags (e.g. the Intel ``VMX`` to expose the
# virtualization extensions to the guest, or ``pdpe1gb`` to configure 1GB
# huge pages for CPU models that do not provide it)::
#
#     [libvirt]
#     cpu_mode = custom
#     cpu_model = Haswell-noTSX-IBRS
#     cpu_model_extra_flags = PCID, VMX, pdpe1gb
#
# As it can be noticed from above, the ``cpu_model_extra_flags`` config
# attribute is case insensitive.  And specifying extra flags is valid in
# combination with all the three possible values for ``cpu_mode``:
# ``custom`` (this also requires an explicit ``cpu_model`` to be
# specified), ``host-model``, or ``host-passthrough``.  A valid example
# for allowing extra CPU flags even for ``host-passthrough`` mode is that
# sometimes QEMU may disable certain CPU features -- e.g. Intel's
# "invtsc", Invariable Time Stamp Counter, CPU flag.  And if you need to
# expose that CPU flag to the Nova instance, the you need to explicitly
# ask for it.
#
# The possible values for ``cpu_model_extra_flags`` depends on the CPU
# model in use.  Refer to ``/usr/share/libvirt/cpu_map.xml`` possible CPU
# feature flags for a given CPU model.
#
# Note that when using this config attribute to set the 'PCID' CPU flag
# with the ``custom`` CPU mode, not all virtual (i.e. libvirt / QEMU) CPU
# models need it:
#
# * The only virtual CPU models that include the 'PCID' capability are
#   Intel "Haswell", "Broadwell", and "Skylake" variants.
#
# * The libvirt / QEMU CPU models "Nehalem", "Westmere", "SandyBridge",
#   and "IvyBridge" will _not_ expose the 'PCID' capability by default,
#   even if the host CPUs by the same name include it.  I.e.  'PCID' needs
#   to be explicitly specified when using the said virtual CPU models.
#
# The libvirt driver's default CPU mode, ``host-model``, will do the right
# thing with respect to handling 'PCID' CPU flag for the guest --
# *assuming* you are running updated processor microcode, host and guest
# kernel, libvirt, and QEMU.  The other mode, ``host-passthrough``, checks
# if 'PCID' is available in the hardware, and if so directly passes it
# through to the Nova guests.  Thus, in context of 'PCID', with either of
# these CPU modes (``host-model`` or ``host-passthrough``), there is no

# Specific cache modes to use for different disk types.
#
# For example: file=directsync,block=none,network=writeback
#
# For local or direct-attached storage, it is recommended that you use
# writethrough (default) mode, as it ensures data integrity and has acceptable
# I/O performance for applications running in the guest, especially for read
# operations. However, caching mode none is recommended for remote NFS storage,
# because direct I/O operations (O_DIRECT) perform better than synchronous I/O
# operations (with O_SYNC). Caching mode none effectively turns all guest I/O
# operations into direct I/O operations on the host, which is the NFS client in
# this environment.
#
# Possible cache modes:
#
# * default: Same as writethrough.
# * none: With caching mode set to none, the host page cache is disabled, but
#   the disk write cache is enabled for the guest. In this mode, the write
#   performance in the guest is optimal because write operations bypass the host
#   page cache and go directly to the disk write cache. If the disk write cache
#   is battery-backed, or if the applications or storage stack in the guest
#   transfer data properly (either through fsync operations or file system
#   barriers), then data integrity can be ensured. However, because the host
#   page cache is disabled, the read performance in the guest would not be as
#   good as in the modes where the host page cache is enabled, such as
#   writethrough mode. Shareable disk devices, like for a multi-attachable block
#   storage volume, will have their cache mode set to 'none' regardless of
#   configuration.
# * writethrough: writethrough mode is the default caching mode. With
#   caching set to writethrough mode, the host page cache is enabled, but the
#   disk write cache is disabled for the guest. Consequently, this caching mode
#   ensures data integrity even if the applications and storage stack in the
#   guest do not transfer data to permanent storage properly (either through
#   fsync operations or file system barriers). Because the host page cache is
#   enabled in this mode, the read performance for applications running in the
#   guest is generally better. However, the write performance might be reduced
#   because the disk write cache is disabled.
# * writeback: With caching set to writeback mode, both the host page cache
#   and the disk write cache are enabled for the guest. Because of this, the
#   I/O performance for applications running in the guest is good, but the data
#   is not protected in a power failure. As a result, this caching mode is
#   recommended only for temporary data where potential data loss is not a
#   concern.
#   NOTE: Certain backend disk mechanisms may provide safe writeback cache
#   semantics. Specifically those that bypass the host page cache, such as
#   QEMU's integrated RBD driver. Ceph documentation recommends setting this
#   to writeback for maximum performance while maintaining data safety.
# * directsync: Like "writethrough", but it bypasses the host page cache.
# * unsafe: Caching mode of unsafe ignores cache transfer operations
#   completely. As its name implies, this caching mode should be used only for
#   temporary data where data loss is not a concern. This mode can be useful for

#
# Configuration options for metrics

#
# From nova.conf

#
# When using metrics to weight the suitability of a host, you can use this
# option
# to change how the calculated weight influences the weight assigned to a host
# as
# follows:
#
# * >1.0: increases the effect of the metric on overall weight
# * 1.0: no change to the calculated weight
# * >0.0,<1.0: reduces the effect of the metric on overall weight
# * 0.0: the metric value is ignored, and the value of the
#   'weight_of_unavailable' option is returned instead
# * >-1.0,<0.0: the effect is reduced and reversed
# * -1.0: the effect is reversed
# * <-1.0: the effect is increased proportionally and reversed
#
# This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use
# a different scheduler, this option has no effect.
#
# Possible values:
#
# * An integer or float value, where the value corresponds to the multipler
#   ratio for this weigher.
#
# Related options:
#
# * weight_of_unavailable
#  (floating point value)
#weight_multiplier = 1.0

#
# This setting specifies the metrics to be weighed and the relative ratios for
# each metric. This should be a single string value, consisting of a series of
# one or more 'name=ratio' pairs, separated by commas, where 'name' is the name
# of the metric to be weighed, and 'ratio' is the relative weight for that
# metric.
#
# Note that if the ratio is set to 0, the metric value is ignored, and instead
# the weight will be set to the value of the 'weight_of_unavailable' option.
#
# As an example, let's consider the case where this option is set to:
#
#     ``name1=1.0, name2=-1.3``
#
# The final weight will be:
#
#     ``(name1.value * 1.0) + (name2.value * -1.3)``
#
# This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use
# a different scheduler, this option has no effect.
#
# Possible values:
#
# * A list of zero or more key/value pairs separated by commas, where the key is
#   a string representing the name of a metric and the value is a numeric weight
#   for that metric. If any value is set to 0, the value is ignored and the

#
# This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use
# a different scheduler, this option has no effect.
#
# Possible values:

# * The ratio specified for a metric in 'weight_setting' is 0
# * The 'weight_multiplier' option is set to 0
#
# This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use

#
# This is an advanced feature which allows the hypervisor to signal to the

# Number of seconds to wait for agent's reply to a request.

# Nova configures/performs certain administrative actions on a server with the
# help of an agent that's installed on the server. The communication between
# Nova and the agent is achieved via sharing messages, called records, over
# xenstore, a shared storage across all the domains on a Xenserver host.
# Operations performed by the agent on behalf of nova are: 'version','
# key_init',
# 'password','resetnetwork','inject_file', and 'agentupdate'.
#
# To perform one of the above operations, the xapi 'agent' plugin writes the
# command and its associated parameters to a certain location known to the
# domain
# and awaits response. On being notified of the message, the agent performs
# appropriate actions on the server and writes the result back to xenstore. This
# result is then read by the xapi 'agent' plugin to determine the
# success/failure
# of the operation.
#
# This config option determines how long the xapi 'agent' plugin shall wait to

# disk which is attached to the compute VM.
# vdi_remote_stream - This plugin implements an image handler which works as a
# proxy between glance and XenServer. The VHD streams to XenServer via a remote
# import API supplied by XAPI for image download; and for image upload, the VHD
