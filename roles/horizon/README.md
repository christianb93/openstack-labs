horizon
=========

This role installs Horizon and is meant to be executed on the controller node.  After installing the Ubuntu Horizon package, there are a couple of changes we need to make to the configuration (which is actually a Python code snippet called local_settings.py). 

* we first set the list ALLOWED_HOSTS from which connections are accepted to * to allow incoming connections from every IP address (which is of course not a good in any non-playground setting)
* we adjust the OpenStack API versions that the Horizon application will use to talk to the individual OpenStack services v
* we enable support for several domains 
* we set the default domain to "default"
* we adjust the URL that Horizon will use to contact Memcached to store session data and the set the session engine
* we set the OpenStack host to be the local host (this is the host where Horizon will look for Keystone)
* set the default role that Keystone will use to create new users to member
* adapt the structure OPENSTACK_NEUTRON_NETWORK: disable all layer 3 features (we only have a layer 2 network at the moment)
