nova
=========

This role installs the nova service on a node. The following configuration are done compared to the packaged version of the configuration file (nova.conf)

* we set the IP on which the Nova services will be listening to the management IP of the controller node (taken from an inventory variable)
* we set use_neutron = true to ask Nova to use Neutron instead of the deprecated nova-network
* we set the firewall_driver to nova.virt.firewall.NoopFirewallDriver to disable it (as described in the comments in the sample configuration)
* we set the transport_url to connect to the RabbitMQ server on the MQ node node using the user openstack and its password
* in the section api, we set the auth_strategy to keystone so that the Nova API service uses Keystone for authentication
* in the section api_database, we provide the connection string to the MySQL database Nova API for the nova user
* in the database section, we provide the connection to the nova database
* in the keystone_authtoken section, we provide the necessary information to use Keystone tokens
* in the neutron section, we provide connection and authorization settings for the neutron service and the metadata proxy service, including a shared secret
* in the oslo_concurrency section, we define a path which is used for lock files
* in the placement section, we define the information that Nova needs to authenticate against the placement service


Requirements
------------

This assumes that Keystone is present and running and that the infrastructure components like MySQL and Rabbit are up and running

keystone_admin_password - the password of the admin user in keystone
nova_db_user_password - password that we will use for the nova DB user
nova_keystone_user_password - the password that we will set for the nova user in Keystone
