keystone
=========

This role installs Keystone on a node. We then modify the default configuration file coming with the package and change the following values:

- section database, key connection: this will be adjusted to point to a MySQL database running on {{mysql_server_name}} and use the DB password {{keystone_db_user_password}}


We also adapt the Apache2 configuration and set the Apache2 server name to the {{inventory_hostname}}, so make sure that this name is valid and resolves to the correct host. Finally, we create a service project in keystone which can be used to register other OpenStack services.
