octavia_api
=========

This role install the Octavia API server, typically on a controller node.  We

* create an octavia Keystone user
* create an Octavia database and a corresponding user
* create services and endpoints
* install the octavia-api package 
* populate the database
* change the default configuration and restart the service

The following changes are made to the default configuration:

* set the URL for the RabbitMQ interface
* change the *bind_host* variable to the management IP of the node on which we are running
* change the auth strategy to keystone
* only expose the v2 API
* change the values in the auth_token section 
* set a topic name in oslo_messaging
* in the service_auth section, configure the authentication data that Octavia will use to communicate with other services (though this is apparantly not really needed by the API service itself)
