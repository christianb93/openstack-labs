neutron_compute
=========

This role installs the neutron on the compute node. It uses a dependency to ovs_agent to install the OVS agent itself and the openvswitch_agent.ini file. It then creates a neutron.conf file and restarts the services.



In neutron.conf, we make the following changes to the sample file distributed with the package.

* we set the transport_url to allow neutron to talk to our RabbitMQ server
* in the default section, we change the auth_strategy to use keystone
* in the section keystone_authtoken, we make the usual changes
* in the oslo_concurrency section, we set the path to the directory in which lock files are stored
* we comment out all database connections as the compute nodes do not connect directly to the database


Requirements
------------

This assumes that Keystone is present and running and that the infrastructure components like MySQL and Rabbit are up and running
